# venture-capital-research-project

These scripts scraped and parsed relevant data from PDF files and exported the result to CSV files. My sample was collected from a VC Experts dataset. The dataset comprised of over 3000 PDF files containing information about U.S. start-up companies that have received venture capital financing (see Sample PDF.pdf for an example of a contract). The cleaned and structured data included information about financings conducted by 2,621 VC firms in 3,311 start-up companies over 4,896 investment rounds. These scripts were used to gather data for a research project on venture capital contract design I conducted through the McDonough School of Business Undergraduate Research Fellowship.
